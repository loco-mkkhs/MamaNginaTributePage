        <p>Ngina Kenyatta, also referred to as "Mama Ngina," is the widow of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, and the mother
        of Uhuru Kenyatta, who presided over Kenya from 2013 until 2022 as its fourth president. She has been affiliated with the
        illustrious political family of Kenya and has made a significant contribution to its history. Here is a summary of her life
        and accomplishments:
        On June 24, 1933, Ngina Kenyatta was born as Ngina Muhoho in Ngenda, Kiambu, British Kenya. In 1951, at the age of 19, she
        wed Jomo Kenyatta. After Kenya gained independence from British colonial authority on December 12, 1963, Jomo Kenyatta, a
        significant figure in the independence movement, was elected as the country's first president. Mama Ngina Kenyatta was a key
        figure in the struggle for Kenya's independence. She stood by her husband's side both throughout Kenya's declaration of
        independence and the tumultuous years that followed. Even though Kenyatta was a polygamist, Mama Ngina assumed the duties of
        the first lady.
        Ngina Kenyatta held the position of First Lady of Kenya from December 1964 to August 1978. She did so despite losing her
        husband in 1978. When Jomo Kenyatta was succeeded by Daniel Arap Moi as president, she was still referred to as the First
        Lady. The mother of Ngina is a devoted Catholic.
        The influence of Mama Ngina Kenyatta goes beyond her position as first lady. She is regarded as the matriarch of the Kenyatta
        family, which controls a huge economic empire with an estimated value of millions of dollars. Shares of Kenya's Commercial
        Bank of Africa, Brookside Dairy, Heritage Hotels East Africa, and Media Max Company are among the companies owned by the
        Kenyatta family. They also possess thousands of acres of valuable land that Jomo Kenyatta bought in Kenya throughout the
        1960s and 1970s.
        Furthermore, offshore accounts in tax havens like Panama and the British Virgin Islands have been connected to Mama Ngina
        Kenyatta and her sons, including Uhuru Kenyatta. With rumours of vast property ownership, involvement in the charcoal trade,
        and other economic endeavours, the family's wealth has drawn attention.Mama Ngina Kenyatta's name has been connected to
        numerous initiatives and famous locations lately. For instance, the Mama Ngina Waterfront Park in Mombasa, which bears her
        name, has benefited from large investments for revitalization. The park seeks to provide entertainment, retail, leisure
        activities, and tourism promotion in the area.
        Mama Ngina Kenyatta will still be a significant influence in Kenya's political and financial environment when she turns 90 on
        June 24, 2023. She is a significant figure in Kenyan society due to her historical contributions to the nation and her status
        as the family matriarch of the Kenyatta clan.</p>
